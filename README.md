   Small browser extension to block the easy creation of bullet and fast blitz games.
   Removes bullet and 3+0 buttons from homepage, removes easy access to ultra/hyper/bullet tournaments,
   and removes access to accepting or creating custom challenges, to make it much harder to play a bullet or fast blitz game.
   Mostly for my own use, to stop my habitually clicking to create a bullet game when I'm bored.

   Todo in the future: add interface where you can set when bullet/blitz games are not blocked from being easily created.
